# Akin API Guide


## Minhash
Akin offers two methods of generating the MinHash object, UniMinHash and MultiMinHash.

## UniMinHash
Creates a MinHash object that contains matrix of Minhash Signatures for each text.  

Texts are shingled and hashed using the bottom-k variant of the MinHash algorithm, each text is hashed once and the k-smallest values selected for k permutations. This method is less computationally intensive than multi_hash but also less stable.

#### UniMinHash Parameters
``` python
UniMinHash(
    text, 
    n_gram=9, 
    n_gram_type='char', 
    permutations=100, 
    hash_bits=64, 
    seed=None
)
```  
**text**  
`{list or ndarray}`  
Iterable containing strings of text for each text in a corpus.<br><br>
**n_gram**  
`int, optional, default: 9`  
Size of each overlapping text shingle to break text into prior to hashing. Shingle size should be carefully selected 
dependent on average text length as too low a shingle size will yield false similarities, whereas too high a shingle 
size will fail to return similar documents.  

For character shingles a size of 5 is recommended for shorter texts such as emails, the default size of 9 is 
recommended for longer texts or documents.<br><br>
**n_gram_type**  
`str, optional, default: 'char'`  
Type of n gram to use for shingles, must be 'char' to split text into character shingles or 'term' to split text into 
overlapping sequences of words.<br><br>
**permutations**  
`int, optional, default: 100`  
Number of randomly sampled hash values to use for generating each texts minhash signature. Intuitively the larger the 
number of permutations, the more accurate the estimated Jaccard similarity between the texts but longer the algorithm 
will take to run.<br><br>
**hash_bits**  
`int, optional, default: 64`  
Hash value size to be used to generate minhash signatures from shingles, must be 32, 64 or 128 bit. Hash value size 
should be chosen based on text length and a trade off between performance and accuracy. Lower hash values risk false 
hash collisions leading to false similarities between documents for larger corpora of texts.<br><br>
**seed**  
`int, optional, default: None`  
Seed from which to generate random hash function, necessary for reproducibility or to allow updating of the LSH model 
with new minhash values later.<br><br>

## MultiMinHash
Creates a MinHash object that contains matrix of Minhash Signatures for each text.  

Texts are shingled, then hashed once per permutation and the minimum hash value selected each time to construct a signature.

**no_of_bands**  
`optional, default: permutations // 2`
